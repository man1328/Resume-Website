### A bit about you
You have strong analytical and problem-solving skills. Curiosity, communication, and logic drive your work. You are organized and know how to
balance speed with accuracy. And you effectively manage relationships and expectations in order to define what's urgent and always be
accountable for excellent outcomes.

* strengthen the language you use when describing your responsibilities by including action words like provided, created, developed, supported, implemented, and generated. For example: “I implemented a new scheduling system that led to 95% of the team meeting deadlines.”
